1. To declare a variable named flagp as a pointer to a Boolean value, you write ___bool *flagp;_____;
2. With the statement double *p1, p2; the type of p1 is ______________ and the type of p2 is __________
3. [ T ] True or false: For any variable x, the expression *&x is essentially a synonym for x.
4. [ F ] True or false: For any variable x, the expression &*x is essentially a synonym for x.
5. [ F ] True or false: If p is a pointer variable, the expression p++ adds 1 to the internal representation of p.
6. The internal representation of the constant NULL is _____ (void*) 0 ______
7. Assume that variables of type double take up eight bytes. If the base address of the array doubleArray is 1000, the address value of doubleArray + 5 is ___1040___
8. [ F ] True or false: Because C treats arrays as pointers to their initial element, declaring an array variable is identical internally to declaring the same variable as a pointer.
9. [ T ] True or false: The operator ++ is applied first in the expression *p++.
10. Write a statement that allocate a dynamic array called flags consisting of 100 Boolean values _________bool *flags = malloc(sizeof *(100* sizeof(bool));___________
